Hello World! Currently transitioning from a Marketing expert to a Software Developer, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table. I've recently completed a rigorous 40-week Full Stack bootcamp at Tech Elevator focusing on Java, PostgreSQL and Vue.js. During the lockdown, I also expanded my horizons with the Odin Project and Udemy courses. Besides technical expertise, my strong background in Communication and Elementary Education equips me to simplify complex tech jargon. 

While I've been working on my technical skills, I've also been optimizing BA websites to boost donations and designing content for a donor loyalty program, which saw a 20% increase in turnout. On the side, I'm delving into Python. So, if you need a perpetual 'techie' who can translate intricate tech concepts into understandable language, feel free to reach out!
